/*
Given an integer array and another integer element. The task is to find if the given element is present in array or not.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1,2,3,4}
x = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one test case 
with array as {1, 2, 3 4} and element 
to be searched as 3.  Since 3 is 
present at index 2, output is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
x = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: For array elements 
{1,2,3,4,5} element to be searched 
is 5 and it is at index 4. So, the 
output is 4.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function search() which takes the array arr[], its size N and the element X as inputs and returns the index of first occurrence of X in the given array. If the element X does not exist in the array, the function should return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1). 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 106
0 <= x <= 105
